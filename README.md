# Reuters news topic classification

This repository contains code for a course project in `Introduction to Deep Learning` (University of Helsinki, Spring 2021). The task for this project concerned multi-label text classification. Specifically, it was to classify Reuters news items by topic(s). I chose to use a pre-trained BERT transformer and fine-tune it.
